# Stirling PDF API

Stirling PDF exposes a simple API for easy integration with external scripts. For an exhaustive list of all available API endpoints and their functions, please refer to the [Swagger Documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/).

 Stirling-PDF's feature set is not entirely confined to the backend, hence not all functionalities are accessible via the API. Certain operations, such as document signing and flattening, are executed exclusively on the front-end, and as such, they are only available through the Web-UI. If you encounter a situation where some API endpoints appear to be absent, it is likely attributable to these front-end exclusive features.

Stirling-PDF also has statistic and health endpoints to integrate with monitoring/dashboard applications such as [Heimdall](https://TODO) and [Fenrus](https://TODO)
