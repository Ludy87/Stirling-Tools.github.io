# Introduction to Stirling PDF

Stirling PDF is a sophisticated, locally hosted, web-based PDF manipulation platform powered by Docker technology. Our application offers an extensive range of functionalities, from simple operations like merging and splitting PDFs, to advanced features such as rotating, compressing, and adding images to your PDF files. 

Originally developed as a purely ChatGPT-powered application, Stirling PDF has evolved to accommodate a plethora of PDF-related needs. Most importantly, the platform guarantees utmost privacy and security as it doesn't make outbound calls for tracking or record keeping. All files and PDFs remain either on the client side, stored temporarily on the server during the execution of tasks, or within a transient file created specifically for task execution. Once the user downloads a file, it is immediately purged from the server.
