# Endpoints Customisation

You can selectively disable and remove endpoints and functionalities from Stirling PDF as per your requirements. `ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE` and `GROUPS_TO_REMOVE` can include comma-separated lists of endpoints and groups to disable. For example, `ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE=img-to-pdf,remove-pages` would disable both the "image to PDF" and "remove pages" functionalities. A complete list of all endpoints and groups is available [here](https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/groups.md).
