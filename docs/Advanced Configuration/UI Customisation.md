# UI Customisation

Stirling PDF allows straightforward customisation of the visible application name using environment variables `APP_HOME_NAME`, `APP_HOME_DESCRIPTION`, and `APP_NAVBAR_NAME` with Docker or Java. If running Java directly, you can also pass these as properties using `-D` arguments. You can also toggle between standard and dark mode themes.
