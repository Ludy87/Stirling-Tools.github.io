# Windows Installation Guide for Stirling PDF

Stirling PDF provides Windows compatibility through a downloadable .exe file, which can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF/releases/latest).
This is a streamlined version of the application, offering the same capabilities as the Stirling-PDF-Ultra-lite found in Docker, but in a compact 80MB executable!

Simply download and launch the .exe file to access the Stirling-PDF Web-UI. It is important to note that this application requires JAVA 17 or 21. If the application identifies that this version of JAVA isn't installed on your system, it will prompt a link to download the appropriate version.

Once launched, the application hosts a web server that is accessible and usable by anyone on your network.
